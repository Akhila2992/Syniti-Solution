1. What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something
   you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I’d
   love to know why you’re proud of it.
	
	My proudest achievement is and will always be my masters degree from Drexel University. 
	I moved to United States after 23 years of being with my parents for education. The experience was beautiful,
	I learnt a great deal about computers for sure but also grew emotionally, personally and financially independent. 
	Migrating continents definitely changed my perspective of life. 
	
	

2. What's a personal project you're currently working on? This could be a
   coding side project, hobby, or otherwise real world project you're working
   on.
	I have a lot of projects currently running. One is I am finally learning new UI framework(React JS) and I am currently working
	on a order management app for restaurants as a sample project. I am also learning and working on Kubernetes application development.
	
	
3. Tell us about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked
   it, and why we should read it.
   Its not a book or an article as such. I came across a few blog posts when I was trying to learn and setup terraform (for a project at work) and I came across 
   a video why to move to terraform and a blog post explaining how to achieve it. 
   https://blog.gruntwork.io/an-introduction-to-terraform-f17df9c6d180
   Terraform by hashicorp is based on the principle "DevOps first" and I think thats very interesting because most of the issues crop up in project delivery due to environment. 
   Terraform eases the setting up of the environment, making it more efficient to debug issues.

4. Tell us about one of your favorite products (physical or software) and one
   specific aspect that makes it truly great.
   My most favorite software in current times has to be JIRA. The ease of use, ease of maintenance of storyboards, tasks ,defects makes it truly great.
